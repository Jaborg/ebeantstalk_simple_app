This is a repository copied over from my Book Review Repo and converted into a Flask application.

It was to test the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service, and at first I couldn't figure out why it was not working with FastAPI.

Hence, I modified to Flask (quite quick) and launched it. I could will probably convert it back when I come back to this project.
